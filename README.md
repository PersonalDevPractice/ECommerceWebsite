## Project Segments

### Docker
- Aims to use a simple docker command ``docker-compose up -d --build`` to create a local project to allow full database, api and frontend simulation

### Vue
- [ ] Create a base VueJs project from the VueCli
- [ ] Change the package file to store commands in shorthand for the processes we require to run in Vue for development

### Backend Api - NodeJS (TypeScript)
- [ ] Create base endpoints that can call to the database image we store in docker once it is up and running
